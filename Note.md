# Notes

## New API to use   

https://frontlinetechnologies.atlassian.net/rest/agile/1.0/board/464/sprint?maxResults=100&startAt=137
mexResults doesn't return more then 50.. poo.


To properly calculate the sprint readiness, we should use the above API ( which handles sprints better, but pages more) to find the created sprints, and see if they are reasonably filled.
